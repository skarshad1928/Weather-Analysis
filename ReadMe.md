# Climate Trend Analysis and Weather Pattern Modeling

This project analyzes multi-year weather data (2022–2025) to study trends in temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind patterns.

Data was collected using the Open-Meteo API and analyzed using Python. Statistical methods and visualizations were applied to identify relationships between meteorological variables and understand climate variability.

Tools used include Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotnine, and Cartopy.
